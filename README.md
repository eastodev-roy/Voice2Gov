# 🗣️ Voice2Gov

**AI-Powered Voice Assistant for Public Complaint Automation**

Voice2Gov simplifies how citizens report issues to local authorities. Instead of filling out forms or navigating complex portals, users can simply **speak** their complaints. The system then automatically converts speech to text, identifies the problem, and routes it to the correct department.
